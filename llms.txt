- [JavaScript: The Support Class That Runs the Game](https://randomthoughtsintraffic.com/javascript-the-support-class-that-runs-the-game/): If you&#8217;d asked me years ago what JavaScript was for, I would&#8217;ve answered the same way most people do. Buttons.Animations.Stuff that happens when you click things. That answer isn&#8217;t wrong &#8211; but it’s incomplete in the way early character builds usually are.
